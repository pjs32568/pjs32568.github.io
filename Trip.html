	<p>U.S. 129 is called the Tail of the Dragon. It is a road
	that contains 318 curves in 11 miles. There are multiple incidents that happen here every year. So many that at a 
	nearby restaurant, there is a "tree of shame," where they hang motorcycle parts that they found on the roads.
	Many things went wrong though. A guy's bike broke down. A guy who rode all the way from Canada
	to be here took a curve too fast on U.S. 129 and ended up... </p>
	<p class='special'>IN THE TREES!!!</p>
	<p>Dad and I stepped up to the plate and led the pack back to the resort. The guides, CEO, and the van driver were all helping the fallen man
	until the paramedics arrived on the scene. We ended up skipping the apple pie stop, and we were all wondering what had happened to the Canadian.
	The last we heard was that his motorcycle was not ridable. He broke his arm and a few ribs. He had to spend some time in the States before he 
	was well enough to travel back. His friend that he rode down with rode back alone. Overall, it was an interesting trip to say the least. We met a lot 
	of great people and had some interesting experiences along the way.</p>
