<p>Hi, my name is Parker and I ride a Triumph Tiger 800XRX. I have been riding since I was 16.
My father and I go on all sorts of rides together. Sometimes it is on the pavement, and other times it is in the dirt.
</p>
<p>I the October of 2016, we took a <a HREF="Trip.html">trip </a>to North Carolina and the Great Smokey Montains with a group.
We had done a tour with this company called Edelweiss Bike Travel in the summer of 2016 and this was their "reunion" ride.
Anyone who has done a ride with them was able to go for a short weekend ride, so we signed up to do it.
The CEO came to ride with us, have dinner and update us on where the company is going.</p>
<h2>Things that I keep on the bike at all times</h2>
</div>
<ul><li>Rain gear</li><li>Tool-Kit</li><li>Half-cover</li><li>Med-Kit</li>
<li>Spray-cleaner (for the faceshield and windshield)</li><li>Spare gloves</li><li>Goggles for off-road</li><li>SPOT Tracker - this is used in case of an emergency.
 It can call emergency services regardless of cellular range.We've had a few close calls of using this, but thankfully haven't had to yet.</li>
<li>The bike manual</li><li>Zip-ties</li><li>Electrical tape</li>
</ul>
<div style="text-align:center">
<p>My father carries similar things on his bike. THe bottom line is that we are prepared for anything that comes our way.
Obviously we can't fix everything that breaks, but we have a better chance of being able to when carrying all of these things.
